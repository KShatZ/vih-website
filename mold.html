                    <p>Prior to starting any construction-related work in a property with suspected lead-based paint
                        materials, an initial inspection is required to stay compliant with local and federal
                        regulations. Our lead inspections are performed with a Niton XRF lead analyzer which allows for
                        non-disruptive testing of possible lead-based paint materials. Upon completion of the lead
                        inspection, we provide a detailed report containing the test results, the location of tested
                        materials, and recommendations moving forward.</p>
